# Evaluating the Global Demand and Supply for Inclusive Innovation

## About

MaRS was the US & Canada regional host for [MIT's Global Inclusive Innovation Challenge] (https://www.mitinclusiveinnovation.com/), run by MIT's Initiative on the Digital Economy. The challenge brings together companies from around the world that are innovating in four categories - Skills Development & Opportunity Matching, Income Growth & Job Creation, Technology Access, and Financial Inclusion - so that the world's lowest means populations can participate and prosper in the digital economy. 

Our research team evaluated the global demand and supply of services that address each area of inclusive innovation. Our goal was to identify the priority needs in different countries, and where there are gaps in meeting those needs.
